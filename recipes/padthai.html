    <img src= "padthai.jpeg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces dry pad thai noodles (rice noodles)</li> 
        <li>Boiling water to cover noodles</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, finely diced (much better than onion here)</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ginger, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, whisked with a fork with a generous 3-finger pinch salt</li>
        <li>6–8 ounces tofu, chicken breast or peeled prawns</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, wok oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Sauce Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce (see notes- or use vegan fish sauce)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar (or coconut sugar, palm sugar or regular sugar)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce (or GF liquid aminos like Braggs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>COOK NOODLES: Cook noodles according to package instructions (or place rice noodles in a shallow bowl or baking dish and boil enough water to cover them. Cover with boiling water for 7- 8 minutes, until tender, then drain. They don’t have to be totally soft, just bendy and pliable)</li>
        <li>Chop shallot, garlic and ginger and set aside.</li> 
        <li>Whisk the two eggs in a bowl with a fork and add a generous, 3-finger pinch of salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the two eggs in a bowl with a fork and add a generous, 3-finger pinch of salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep the protein. Chicken: slice chicken into very thin strips and season with salt and pepper. Crispy Tofu: Blot tofu with paper towels pressing down firmly. Cut tofu into ¾ inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and for extra crispy, dredge in a little corn starch. Shrimp:  Peel and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the protein: Sear the seasoned chicken, shrimp or tofu in a wok with hot oil until cooked through over medium-high heat. Set aside, on top of a paper towel, wipe out the pan. Turn heat off.</li>
        <li>STIR FRY the PAD THAI: Gather your chopped shallots, whisked eggs, cooked noodles, cooked protein and Pad Thai sauce around the stove. Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in the wok over medium heat, add shallot-garlic-ginger and stir, cooking just a few minutes until golden and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the wok, scooting the shallot mixture to the side of the pan, add the whisked eggs. With a metal spatula, scramble them and break them apart into little bits, letting them brown just a little, and incorporate them into the shallots continuing to break them into small bits.</li>
        <li>Add the drained, semi-soft noodles and toss with the egg mixture, stirring, flipping, frying constantly for 3-4 minutes until noodles become soft and pliable. </li>
        <li>Add the Pad Thai Sauce and cook 1 minute.  It will smell quite fishy at first – turn your fan on – but it will mellow out perfectly. Add the cooked chicken, tofu or shrimp and turn and toss the noodles for a few more minutes. Cook until the noodles are soft (but still a little chewy) adding just a little water if it seems too dry.        </li>
        <li>Toss in the bean sprouts and roasted peanuts (or serve on the side) and sprinkle with chili flakes and scallions. Squeeze with a little lime juice. Taste. Adjust salt, lime and sweetness to your liking adding a pinch of salt, more lime or more a pinch more sugar to taste. Give one more toss and serve immediately. Divide among two plates.</li>
        <li>Garnish with more bean sprouts, fresh scallions, cilantro or basil, chili flakes, lime wedges and roasted crushed peanuts. Or make this Peanut Chili Crunch!</li>
    </ol>
